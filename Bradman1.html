<p>Donald Bradman is considered the greatest batsman of all time and with a test average of <b>99.94</b> who can argue. It is about 40 runs more than the next highest average of any player with a minimum 20 tests. His average is considered the pinnacle of any sportsman in any mayor sport.</p>

<p>Donald George Bradman was born on 27 August 1908 at Cootamundra, New South Wales. In his youth he used to play his own game at home using a stump for a bat and a golf ball. By hitting the ball against a curved wall it would rebound in unexpected ways, this honed his timing skills. Bradman made his first class debut at 19 for NSW and scored 118 runs, a sign of thins to come. He made his test debut in the 1928-29 season, but he could only score 18 and 1 in his first test. It took only 3 tests for his average to reach 50 (the sign of a great player) and then there was no stopping him. Even with the infamous Bodyline tactics (where the ball is bowled at the body so that the batsman is forced to use his bat) used by England in the 1932-33 tour, which was used to try and stop him had little effect as he still averaged 56. Hi career was cut short by the Second World War. After the war he captained the Australia team that became known as the "Invincibles". Even though he was not at his best he still scored 2428 first class runs on his last tour of England. During his last test he only had to score 4 runs for his average to be 100, but he was bowled out for a duck.</p>

<p>After his playing career his was involved in the administration of Australian Cricket and served as a board member of 16 publicly listed companies. in 1949 he was Knighted for his services to cricket, the only Australian cricketer to be so honoured. In December 2000 he was hospitalise with pneumonia and passed away at home on 25 February 2001, aged 92.</p>
